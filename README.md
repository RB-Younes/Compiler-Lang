# Mini-Compiler Project

The objective of this project is to develop a mini-compiler that performs various phases of compilation for the "Lang" language. It involves lexical analysis using the FLEX tool and syntax-semantics analysis using the BISON tool. Parallel processing for symbol table management and error handling is also implemented throughout the compilation process.

## Features

- Lexical analysis with FLEX
- Syntax-semantics analysis with BISON
- Parallel processing for symbol table management
- Error handling at various compilation phases
